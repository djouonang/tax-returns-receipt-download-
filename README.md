# tax-returns-receipt-download-
WordPress plugin to enable charity donors to download tax returns receipt on donations they have made. This plugin  replicates the functionality on Canadahelps.org(https://www.canadahelps.org/en/tax-receipts/).

The plugin works by allowing donors to use a front end form provided by the plugin to enter their email address and select a year of their donations and then they will get a tax receipt of all the donations they have made in that year. 

A download link is emailed to donor's email address from which the donor can download all the tax receipts in a zipped folder  by clicking the link.

Features
