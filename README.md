The plugin works by allowing donors to use a front end form provided by the plugin to enter their email address and select a year of their donations and then they will get a tax receipt of all the donations they have made in that year. A download link is emailed to donor's email address from which the donor can download all the tax receipts in a zipped folder  by clicking the link
